## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Word-scramble-Game, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Before reporting though, please review our existing issues and pull requests to see if the problem has already been reported.

If you don't find an existing issue, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/Yagna-gajjar/Mini-Games/issues/new).

If you're not comfortable providing your report publicly, you can email us directly at yagnagangajaliya@gmail.com

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
